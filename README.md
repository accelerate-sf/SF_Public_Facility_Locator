# SF Public Facility Locator: On-the-Go Access to San Franciscoâ€™s Public Amenities

## Problem Statement
The City of San Francisco has a valuable asset in its public dataset and map of public bathrooms and water fountains, especially for residents and visitors in need of these facilities while on the move. Despite having the raw [data](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/San-Francisco-Public-Bathrooms-and-Water-Fountains/wfq4-upmv) and [map](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/Map-of-Public-Bathrooms-and-Water-Fountains/5zvx-hht7) available, there lacks a user-friendly mobile interface to quickly locate and navigate to the nearest amenities. The goal is to develop a web app with a mobile interface that leverages this data to provide real-time location and direction services to the closest public bathrooms and water fountains.

## Focus Areas
1. User-Friendly Mobile Interface:
- Design a clean, intuitive mobile interface that allows users to easily access the location service for finding nearby public amenities.
- Ensure the web app is responsive and accessible across a variety of devices, including smartphones and tablets.

2. Real-Time Location and Direction Services:
- Implement a feature for real-time tracking of user's location to provide accurate and immediate directions to the nearest facilities.
- Integrate with existing map and navigation services to offer turn-by-turn directions to the selected public bathroom or water fountain.

3. Data Integration and Updation:
- Seamlessly integrate the provided dataset and map into the web app to power the location and direction services.
- Establish a mechanism for regular data updation to reflect any changes or additions to the public amenities.

4. Accessibility and Inclusivity:
- Ensure the app is accessible to people with disabilities by adhering to the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) standards.
- Provide features like voice commands and text-to-speech for enhanced usability.

## Objectives

- Develop a web app with a mobile interface that simplifies the process of finding and navigating to the nearest public bathroom or water fountain in San Francisco.
- Implement real-time location tracking and direction services that guide users efficiently to the desired amenities.
- Ensure seamless integration and regular updation of the provided dataset and map to keep the app accurate and up-to-date.
- Promote accessibility and inclusivity by adhering to relevant standards and implementing user-friendly features for all individuals.

## Guiding Questions

- How will the mobile interface be designed to ensure ease of use, especially in urgent situations where quick access to facilities is needed?
- What technologies will be employed to provide real-time location and direction services, and how will they integrate with the existing dataset and map?
- How will the app ensure the accuracy and timeliness of the data, especially in the case of any changes or additions to the public amenities?
- What measures will be taken to ensure the app is accessible and inclusive to all users, including those with disabilities?
